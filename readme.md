# Color Match
A small game to get my feet wet using phaser.io. It's not 100% complete, but it was enough for me to get the basics of how to use phaser and html5 canvas. Currently there are no plans to finish this game and/or fix any bugs. 

## How to use:
- Drop files into server
- Use arrows to move to match color of middle shape
- Optional: Change the value of countdown text to make game harder
